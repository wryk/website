		Hello there, I'm **wryk**, a young french developer, passionate about development and japanese popular culture.
		
		## Job
		I work in a small company since 2013, mainly doing web development with PHP (self-certified Symfony expert *wink wink*). I'm also a JavaScript (LiveScript, TypeScript, etc) user and I'm fluent with common web technologies. I know others languages too like Perl6, Ruby, Java and Haskell but I'm not experienced enough with them.
		
		## Hobbies
		I spend most of my free time between developing almost functionnal things, making stunning cosplay stuff, and watching animes.
